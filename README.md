## Introduction

This Codecademy project called Jammming was made by me after finishing an introduction course on React. The purpose of the project was to use React to create components to achieve the following goals:

- The app has a search bar in which a user may search for his/her favorite music. It uses the Spotify database to find those songs.
- It has a search results components where the best matched results will appear as a tracklist after the initial search. The user may add songs from this component to the playlist.
- The playlist component renders de added songs from the search results component. The user is able to delete added songs as well, and change the name of playlist as he/she wishes. 
- The playlist has a button which automatically adds the playlist to the user’s Spotify account.

## Current Issues

The application gives a CORS error when attempting to upload the playlist to the user’s Spotify account. The request header field headers is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
